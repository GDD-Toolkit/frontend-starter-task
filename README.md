# Directions
For this starter task, you must attempt to replicate the "Color Counter" from scratch. This interface will allow users to click on any button which corresponds to a color. After clicking on the button, the # of clicks for that button or color should increase. Finally, the user has the ability to clear the board or in other words, clear the click counts.

To start, divide your code into 3 sections: .html, .js, and .css. Let these be located in a src folder.

Again, replicate this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/166txm971FKz1kipHk9B3z/Frontend-Starter-Tasks?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=ro6JGb1jC9AgTw6m-0).
