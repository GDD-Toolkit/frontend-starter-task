# Directions
For this starter task, you must attempt to replicate the "Color Counter" web app. This web app will allow users to click on any button which corresponds to a color. After clicking on the button, the # of clicks for that button or color should increase. Finally, the user has the ability to clear the board or clear the click counts.

Again, replicate this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/166txm971FKz1kipHk9B3z/Frontend-Starter-Tasks?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=ro6JGb1jC9AgTw6m-0).

IMPORTANT: Read this [Guidelines doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x-ARz-43vumOqSSh480ojD0nTdyqLaKZhF-MYAV-klQ/edit?usp=sharing) before you start and after you finish. It will tell you how to make and add your changes to this application. Additionally, it will consist of guidelines on styling!

If you have any questions, reach out to Jessica Nguyen on Slack!

## Guidelines

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
